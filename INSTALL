libxfoil uses CMake to configure and build. distutils is used to build and
install the Python bindings. A basic build can use the following steps:

# Build and install library with C and Fortran bindings
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" ..
make
make install
cd ..

# Build and install python bindings
python setup.py build_ext
python setup.py install

To see available build options, use ccmake. Sample build scripts are also
included.
